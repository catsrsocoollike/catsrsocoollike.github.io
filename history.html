        <h3>Beginnings</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The true origin of metal may be debated over, however, most metalheads can agree that heavy metal was born near the 1970's in England's West Midlands. Black Sabbath was one of the first bands to emerge with the metal sound. In Hertford, another band called Deep Purple was forming.Many bands followed in the following years such as Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Metallica.</p>

    <h3>The Decline and Eventual Return of Metal</h3>
    <p>Around the 1990's, grunge music was capturing the ears of many listeners. Bands like Nirvana and Alice in Chains rose in popularity as heavy metal bands started to become less popular.
    <br>
    In the 2000's, metal bands were becoming more diverse than the orignal heavy metal that was introduced in the 1970's. As more and more bands emerged, so did the popularity of metal. Some of the older bands that had disbanded in the past had even gotten back together due to the rappidly growing fanbase surrounding metal.
